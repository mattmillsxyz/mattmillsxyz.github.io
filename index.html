        Hey, I'm Matt Mills, a Digital Artist and Software Engineer from Austin, Texas. I've always
        had an interest in computers and design. I picked up programming in high school but it
        wasn't until after college that I started creating digital art as a creative escape from a
        boring day job. Over the years I've dabbled in many styles utilizing every piece of software
        I could get my hands on.

        I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing clients and teams over the past few

      <h2><strong>My Artwork</strong></h2>
      <div>
        My artwork comes from a place of introspection and experimentation. It is a free-flowing
        creative expression released during the small amount of time that I set aside at the end of
        each day. I spend most of my day writing code and building complex systems. While that
        itself is a creative endeavor, there is another creative fire that burns deep within me. A
        fire fueled by emotion, music, and past experiences.
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div>
        So, at the end of every day, I sit down and put on some music, open up Photoshop and just
        start playing with shapes and colors. No sketches, no intentions, just pure creative flow.
        The artwork is very abstract and seems to connect with various people in different ways,
        invoking a range of feelings. In that sense, I don't think it is a coincidence that the
        artwork has resonated with many musicians. In the past few years, I have been hired as a
        freelancer to work on projects for Odesza, Bassnectar, Opiuo/CloZee, Louis Futon, and many
        others. My artwork has also been licensed by over 300 independent musicians and producers to
        be used as album artwork. That still blows my mind a bit.
      </div>
      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>
        I get asked <em>a lot</em> about what software I use to create my artwork. Over the years,
        I've used a wide variety of software applications on various projects. But, my current
        process relies heavily on
        <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" title="Adobe Photoshop"
          >Adobe Photoshop</a
        >
        and a plug-in called

          title="FilterForge Photoshop plugin"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >FilterForge</a
        >. I also utilize Maxon's

        for creating 3D elements and animations.

      <h2><strong>Art Grab</strong></h2>
      <div>
        Freelancing in the music industry has created a lot of opportunities and friendships. It is
        those relationships that led me, and several other artists, to start work on building a
        platform to connect visual artists with musicians, record labels, and agencies that are in
        need of artwork. What we've built is called
        <a
          href="htps://artgrab.co"
          target="_blank"
          title="Art Grab: Exclusive Album Cover Art for Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Art Grab</a
        >. It's a platform where visual artists can upload artwork to be exclusively licensed for
        cover artwork, merchandise, posters, and more. Independent musicians, record labels, and
        management agencies can search the site for the perfect artwork for their next project and
        exclusively license it directly from the artist.
